In this experiment we are expected to implement a hospital management system. 
There will be two main parts to this assignment.

• One part consists of creating the system’s input-output interface and implementing the
logic for this interaction. We will also use decorator design pattern in this part of
the experiment.

• The other part is defining (and implementing) the persistence backend (i.e. how we
store and retrieve the information our system uses).
Our program will take commands from an input file then it will print the results of these
commands to an output file. We will use Data Access Objects (DAO) to manage our
data.
